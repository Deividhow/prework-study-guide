## The motivation behind this project was to have a place where all my notes can be kept in order.This makes it an easily accessable place t be able to see my notes. I learned so much information on what steps are needed to be able to build a website.For example I knew a little bit of CSS and HTML but this explained to me a little more about what some of the elements mean and how they interact with eachother. It also taught me about git and JavaScript which I knew nothing about.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
